OK. This is a really interesting start. Because the blocks you're adding are smaller than the kind of fairly detailed instructions I had in my original repository, I'm wondering if it would be possible to make them a little bit more detailed so that when they're put together they could form something really compelling. 

The other request I have is whether it would be possible to Use individual files for all of the different elements that we're Using in the system. My rationale for thinking that this would be a good approach is that it would be easier to maintain and update the list of elements if they were separate from the main program file. 

Additionally, if you could attempt to increase upon the number of examples I've given in each category so that we have a greater range of things for the users to try, that would be pretty cool too.
